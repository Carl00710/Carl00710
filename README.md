Hey there, I'm Carl! I'm a random teenager on the internet trying to become a someone for others! In the future, I would like to specialize in the gaming sector of programming, mainly modding other games and creating my own.
As for now, I only know the basics of C/C++ so I can't do that much, but I'm willing to learn to improve!
